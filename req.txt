 Library
We want to digitalize the management of our local library.


A library is a place where users can borrow items. Items to borrow are CDs and Books.
 Every borrowable item has a name and an ID. CDs have a certain number of tracks on them.
 Books have a certain number of pages. Books can be Novels, Textbooks and Encyclopedias.

Potential users are local residents and students, whose name and ID we want to save. Local
residents can only borrow 3 items for 7 days,
 but students can borrow up to 5 items for 14 days.
 If a user has been late returning items 3 times,
 then they are blocked from borrowing items in the future.

The head librarian wants to keep a record for each time an item has been borrowed containing:
 the item's ID, the user who took it,
when it was borrowed and when it was returned.

To publicly shame tardy residents,
 we need to know which item is currently overdue for the longest amount of time.
